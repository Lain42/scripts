# scripts
1. The first step into adding scripts to Files is to create the directory where it expects your scripts to be. If it doesnâ€™t exist already, create the following directory:

```
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/
```
2. Create script 
```
vim ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/convert_to_jpeg
echo -e "$NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS" | xargs -i convert "{}" "{}.jpg"
```
3. Make the script executable
```
chmod +x ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/convert_to_jpeg
```
